This is an implementation of breadth/depth first search based on the algorithm presented in the book; Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition.
There are four five files that are need to successfully run the Depth and Breadth First Search algorithms implementation; Vertex, Graph, DepthFirstSearch, BreadthFirstSearch and main.
